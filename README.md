<h3>Linked Lists</h3>
A Linked List is a dynamic data structure which is used to store data in an organized manner , The size is not needed to be defined at the beginning when they are created.
They store the data in an unorganized manner(i.e. At random memory locations unlike as arrays.).
<br>
They are of three types Singly, Double and Circular Linked Lists.(All the possible operations are done in Python).
<h4>(i) Singly Linked List :</h4>
A type of linear linked list that is unidirectional and it contains only two parts : one data part and one linked part . It can only be traversed in one direction .
<h4>(ii) Doubly Linked List :</h4>
A type of linear linked list that is bidirectional and it three parts : one data part and two linked parts . It can be traversed in both the directions .
<h4>(iii) Circular Singly Linked List :</h4>
A non-linear linked list with a slight variation in the singly linked list's last node. Here the last node is linked to the first node , making a circular chain.
<h4>(iv) Circular Doubly Linked List :</h4>
Same as doubly linked list but here the the previous part of first node connects to the last node and the next part of the last node is linked to the first node , making a Circular Chain.
