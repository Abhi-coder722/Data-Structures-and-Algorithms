<h3>Linked Lists</h3>
A Linked List is a dynamic data structure which is used to store data in an organized manner , The size is not needed to be defined at the beginning when they are created.
They store the data in an unorganized manner(i.e. At random memory locations unlike as arrays.).
<br>
<br>
They are of three types Singly, Double and Circular Linked Lists.(All the possible operations are done in Python).
<br>
<h4>(i) Singly Linked List :</h4>
A type of linear linked list that is unidirectional and it contains only two parts : one data part and one linked part . It can only be traversed in one direction .
<h4>(ii) Doubly Linked List :</h4>
A type of linear linked list that is bidirectional and it three parts : one data part and two linked parts . It can be traversed in both the directions .
